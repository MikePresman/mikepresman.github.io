<p>Hey ! My name is Mike Presman and I am a 27 year old software infrastructure engineer working at gadget.dev as an SRE</p>
<p>I love computers and tech.
Â </p>
<p>I want to spend the rest of my solving problems related to software, specifically infrastructure problems.
For quite a while I&rsquo;ve been fasctincated with solving complicated problems at scale and being curious about how others do it. After all its hard enough to solve a problem for one person so why not make it more interesting by trying to solve it for millions of people at once - for me, thats where the magic is.</p>
<p>Â 
What tools and technology I learn as of today are important to me of course - but nontheless they are mere tools !
I don&rsquo;t aim to be glued to them for the rest of my life, I&rsquo;ve only been in the industry for ~2years now and I&rsquo;ve understand that things change (bear in mind I am a fan of this mindset and mindframe for many things <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">choose boring techology</a>)</p>
<p>But with that in mind what tools do I want to learn for this year 2023? Good question.
Interestingly enough, nothing new and interesting I want to hone my skills on the tested and proven.
Kubernetes, Postgres, Low Level Networking, Go, Redis and other cool shit. Most importantly I want to learn these technologies and how they are used at scale. Redis is cool but lets learn the infra stuff. Master leader pattern, the election process, etc.</p>
<p>Â 
Oh ya this site. I&rsquo;ve wanted to set a blogging site up for myself for some quite some time now. As you can tell I don&rsquo;t want anything fancy or complicated. I want to focus on writing quality content and disregarding the style.</p>
<p>Â 
Â 
The purpose of this site isn&rsquo;t quite cut and dry - I know I want to write and the main drive is to discuss technical topics I&rsquo;ve learned or want to learn about and expand on my thoughts on opinons, but overall there is no one specific liited focus. Sometimes I might want to write about other categories. I&rsquo;ll do my best to gage my audience and write what they would like to read.</p>
<p>Â 
What I get out of it isn&rsquo;t quite cut and dry either. I&rsquo;m just writing. maybe i like to write and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. maybe i hope you&rsquo;ll get something out of it. Lets not worry so much, lets just have fun.</p>
