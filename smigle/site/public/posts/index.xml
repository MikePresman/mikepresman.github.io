      <description>BEGIN Hey ! My name is Mike Presman and I am a 27 year old software infrastructure engineer working at gadget.dev as an SRE
I love computers and tech. I want to spend the rest of my solving problems related to software, specifically infrastructure problems. For quite a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been fasctincated with solving complicated problems at scale and being curious about how others do it. After all its hard enough to solve a problem for one person so why not make it more interesting by trying to solve it for millions of people at once - for me, thats where the magic is.</description>
