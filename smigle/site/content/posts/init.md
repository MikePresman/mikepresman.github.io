Who Am I?\
A 27 year old software infrastructure engineer working at gadget.dev as an SRE
what i want to work on ?

I've wanted to set a blogging site up for myself for some quite some time now. As you can tell I don't want anything fancy or complicated. I want to focus on writing quality content and disregarding the style.

The purpose of this site isn't quite cut and dry - I know I want to write and the main drive is to discuss technical topics I've learned or want to learn about and expand on my thoughts on opinons, but overall there is no one specific liited focus. Sometimes I might want to write about other categories. I'll do my best to gauge my audience and write what they would like to read.
