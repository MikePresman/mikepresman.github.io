### BEGIN

Hey ! My name is Mike Presman and I am a 27 year old software infrastructure engineer working at gadget.dev as an SRE

I love computers and tech.
&nbsp;

I want to spend the rest of my solving problems related to software, specifically infrastructure problems.
For quite a while I've been fasctincated with solving complicated problems at scale and being curious about how others do it. After all its hard enough to solve a problem for one person so why not make it more interesting by trying to solve it for millions of people at once - for me, thats where the magic is.

&nbsp;
What tools and technology I learn as of today are important to me of course - but nontheless they are mere tools !
I don't aim to be glued to them for the rest of my life, I've only been in the industry for ~2years now and I've understand that things change (bear in mind I am a fan of this mindset and mindframe for many things [choose boring techology](https://boringtechnology.club/))

But with that in mind what tools do I want to learn for this year 2023? Good question.
Interestingly enough, nothing new and interesting I want to hone my skills on the tested and proven.
Kubernetes, Postgres, Low Level Networking, Go, Redis and other cool shit. Most importantly I want to learn these technologies and how they are used at scale. Redis is cool but lets learn the infra stuff. Master leader pattern, the election process, etc.

&nbsp;
Oh ya this site. I've wanted to set a blogging site up for myself for some quite some time now. As you can tell I don't want anything fancy or complicated. I want to focus on writing quality content and disregarding the style.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The purpose of this site isn't quite cut and dry - I know I want to write and the main drive is to discuss technical topics I've learned or want to learn about and expand on my thoughts on opinons, but overall there is no one specific liited focus. Sometimes I might want to write about other categories. I'll do my best to gage my audience and write what they would like to read.

&nbsp;
What I get out of it isn't quite cut and dry either. I'm just writing. maybe i like to write and that's all there is to it. maybe i hope you'll get something out of it. Lets not worry so much, lets just have fun.
